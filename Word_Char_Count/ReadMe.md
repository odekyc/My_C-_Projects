Write a C-program that asks for text input from the keyboard. The output of this program should be the amount of characters, the amount of words and the amount of newlines that have been typed. Multiple consecutive spaces shouldnot be counted as multiple words. Reading keys from the keyboard is possible by using the function getchar(). The reading of characters from the keyboard can be stopped when the shutdown-code ^D (CTRL + D) is entered. ^D has the ASCII-value 4 (see forum discusson on this exercise). Use a while loop.
