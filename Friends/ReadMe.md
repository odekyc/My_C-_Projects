Normally, only member functions of a class can access the private members of that class. Global functions and other classes can’t access the private members of that class. You can make an exception on that rule by declaring certain functions or classes as friend. For example the << operator for sending the point or line to the std::ostream class had to be a global function and thus can’t access the private members. Move the << operator of Point and Line inside the class definition and declare it as friend. The function remains a global function but it can now access the data members directly without the need for calling the getters or ToString() function. Normally, friends are to be avoided because it violates the data hiding principle. But in case of global operator functions it makes sense because you would actually want to make those global operator functions as member function but this was not possible.
