# My_C++_Projects
all the C++ take home assignments I've done so far from learning the language at Baruch College CUNY pre-Master in Financial Engineering C++ certificate program. I actually took this certificate program back in October 2014. this certificate program is my first exposure to programming/coding ever since I took Java programming class back in undergraduate.
