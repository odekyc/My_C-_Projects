# My_Cplusplus_Projects
all the C++ projects I've done so far( I learned these projects from Baruch College CUNY pre-Master in Financial Engineering C++ certificate program).I actually took this certificate program over a year ago, back in October 2014. this certificate program is my first exposure to programming/coding ever since I took one C++ introductory programming class back in undergraduate. therefore, my programming knowledge at the time I complete these C++ exercises were not as advanced as when I did my python projects( https://github.com/odekyc/My_Python_Projects)
