Create a C-program that reads the characters from the keyboard and shows them on screen (the inputted characters should only be displayed when the user hits 'enter', line by line). When ^A is entered, the program must end properly. Then the following message will appear: “CTRL + A is a correct ending.” Tip: getchar() reads and putchar() writes the type int. The value of ^A is 1.
