Create a C-program that counts how many times each of the numbers 0-4 have been typed. Use a switch-case construction. Use default to count the number of other characters. The input will be halted with ^Z (EOF). EOF means End-of-File and is defined in <stdio.h>. Thus, the constant EOF can be used in a condition (test if EOF has been typed). Print the amount of times a certain number has been typed. Name the program freq.c See this forum discussion
