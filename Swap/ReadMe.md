Try to create a function Swap(). This function must exchange the value of two variables. For example: if i=123 and j=456, then i=456 and j=123 after the Swap() function has been called. The variables i and j are declared, initialised and printed in the function main(). This problem can be solved by using pointers as arguments for the Swap()function.
