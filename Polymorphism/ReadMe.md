The ToString() functions of Point and Line override the ToString() from the Shape base class. We saw that we could put aPoint in a Shape* variable. But when calling the ToString() method on the Shape* variable, the function in Shape was called instead the one in Point. To make the compiler generate the required code to find out what type of object the Shape*variable is actually pointing to so it can call the right version; we need to declare the function as virtual. Thus declare the ToString() function in the Shape class as virtual and test the program again. Is the ToString() function of Point called when you use a Shape* that contains a Point now?
