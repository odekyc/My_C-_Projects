Create a C-program that uses the fact that 0 (zero) is interpreted as FALSE and non-zero is interpreted as TRUE. The C-program can be made easier to read when this 0 (or non-zero) is assigned to a variable e.g. an int called married. Use the ?: operator to print if someone is married or not. (See if you can use a single printf)
