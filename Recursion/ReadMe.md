Write a recursive function printnumber() which gets the number to be printed. This number is an integer. The function should print the number digit by digit by using the putchar() function. Don’t use printf(). Tips: Use the modulo operator (%) to determine the digit to print. Use the division operator (/) to calculate the argument for the recursive call. Don’t forget to handle negative numbers correctly.
